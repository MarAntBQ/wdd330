           <p>Construction of objects was something in my life I couldn’t understand perfectly, maybe because I’m the kind of programmer that takes things in an easy way, but it’s really interesting to see the way to use the “<strong>THIS</strong>” word, this is the perfect example:<br><br><strong>function sayHi() {<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;alert( this.name );<br>}</strong><br><em>In this case we’re talking about the user object.</em><br><br>Now let’s go deeper about Objects, we need to know that it’s a self-contained set of related values and functions, for example a vehicle, it has different parts, and it can perform different actions with those parts, example: “move forward with the 4 tires”<br>I learn for first time about to use Brackets when you’re assigning properties, or methods in objects, recognize them it’s really cool if we use a for each with the word key.<br><br>Here there’s a tip: “<em>An object is not an ordered list like an array, set or map, so you should never rely on the properties being in a certain order</em>”.<br><br>We can change the properties, or remove them, I think about them as more complex variables, so they have the same functions.<br><br>Important update: <em>“If you’re cloning an object, the changes will affect to the original one. So, try to create a new object and then clone the object.”</em><br><br>When I came to the JSON part, it’s really interesting because they can work as a Non related DataBase, also the MATH functions are really useful, they have the most common tools, so it’s up to use to use in the right way. Now, talking about Regular Expressions is really confusing, I remember it with the CIT 225 “SQL Class” but it’s like generating text with an specific declared pattern.<br><br>Now in order to understand about Regular Expressions topic we need to know about its properties:<br><br>“The global property makes the pattern return all matches. By default, the pattern only looks for the first occurrence of a match.<br><br>The ignoreCase property makes the pattern case-insensitive. By default, they are case sensitive.<br><br>The multiline property makes the pattern multiline. By default, a pattern will stop at the end of a line”<br><br>We know that Javascript was created to be used in the browser so here there comes the DOM.<br><br>What does DOM mean? Document Object Model, it allows me to interact with the elements of my web page, for example used get Element by ID, so where I’m playing an important role with that element.<br><br>I really like the way to make a tree diagram of elements in DOM, it’s really helpful in order to understand perfectly each element and how to interact with JS, I love when it says that “The best way to know the DOM is through the Developer Tools” I love it because I can make a hover or put the mouse over, and it shows me where I am.<br><br>Working with Legacy DOM shortcut methods are awesome, I used to work with document.SomeFunction but now I understand better the reasons why.<br><br>With Query Selectors I can use CSS notation to find the 1st element in the document that matches a CSS selector, or use the All() to return all the elements. I didn’t know about to get the text Content of an element, now I know that there’s a property of doing that also the nodeValue works too. Also, I can find other attributes by specifying. <br><br>At the end of this topic, it’s really amazing everything we can do, I love the innerHTML because it lets me to change the elements or rewrite again. We can change and make great things, so the best part is practice.<br><br>Now let’s talk about Events, that topics it’s really cool because we begin to work with interaction in our Pages. I like the example of waiting for an email, so it’s really helpful to let the system to check it automatically.<br><br>The onclick even it’s the most used, it’s really helpful for example “open the menu bar in a mobile version”<br><br>If we understand the parts of events, for example understand it as an object, what’s its target, the function to perform, it’s like a car that when you turn on something an event occurs according to your selection. I was impressed with the coordinates of an Event because with the console.log we can see where the mouse is going.<br><br>We have different events so for example we have the Mouse events, it’s really cool because with mouseover it’s like the hover property but it works under CSS, after we have the keyboard events, and it’s really to know the difference between the keydown and keypress events, the first one will occur if the key is held down, the Shift, Ctrl, Alt and meta (Cmd on Mac will be modifier keys, they fire the keydown and keyup but not the keypress.<br><br>Talking about Touch events, I remember when I worked with Sliders, they only worked with onclick, but it’s really cool to know about these kind of events.

            <br>
            <ul>
                <li> Can I change or remove a property if I use const instead of let when I’m working with an object?</li>
                <li>What does Diwali mean? And why is working with the date functions?</li>
