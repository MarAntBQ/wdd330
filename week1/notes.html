           <p>This week has been really interesting about this Course, in first time, it wasn't totally new for me, because for my daily job, I need to use some functions that we learned.</p>
           <p>The Book "<a href="https://github.com/yenrab/doing_stuff_with_web_things">Doing Stuff with Web Things</a>" is a really powerful tool if you want to remember, improve your foundations and begin with JS, because in every step it was telling you, why it's that code doing, so it's really great.</p>
           <p>But, for me what really challenged me: "Create the portafolio". It's because I needed to use some of the fundations in order to make dinamic menus from an array.</p>
           <p>So finally, I reviewed the code from the book, and make changes, and practices until it was working, so here you can see it:</p>
