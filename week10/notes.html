            <h2>Further Functions</h2>
            <p>It’s really important to return again to our knowledge about Functions.</p>
            <p>-Function Properties and Methods<br>They can have properties and methods, and most of them return some result according the parameters, and performance.</p>
            <p>-Call and Apply Methods<br>It can be used to set the value of this inside a function to an object that is provided as the first argument. We can use it to create objects with the same property. We can update a function if we change the arguments value.</p>
            <p>-Memoization<br>It is an optimization technique used primarily to speed up computer programs by storing the results of expensive function calls and returning the cached result when the same inputs occur again.</p>

            <p><strong>Immediately Invoked Function Expressions</strong></p>
            <p>It is an anonymous function that is invoked as soon as it’s defined. The function also has to be made into an expression, which is done by placing the whole declaration inside parentheses.</p>
            <p>-Temporary Variables<br>There is no way to remove a variable from a scope once it’s been declared. Placing any code that uses the temporary variable inside an IIFE will ensure it’s only available while the IIFE is invoked, then it will disappear. An IIFE can be used to set up any initialization code that there’ll be no need for again.</p>

            <br>
            <p>-Safe Use of Strict Mode<br>The recommended way to use strict mode is to place all your code inside an IIFE.</p>
            <p>-Creating Self-contained Code Blocks<br>An IIFE can be used to enclose a block of code inside its own private scope so it doesn’t interfere with any other part of the program. Also, the code can be added or removed separately</p>
            <p><strong>Functions that Define and Rewrite Themselves</strong></p>
            <p>The dynamic nature of JavaScript means that a function is able to not only call itself, but define itself, and even redefine itself. The initialization can be done the first time it’s called, then the function can be redefined to what you want it to be for every subsequent invocation.</p>
            <p>-Init-Time Branching<br>We can use them to create functions that rewrite themselves. This enables the functions to work more effectively in the browser, and avoid checking for features every time they’re invoked.</p>
            <p><strong>Recursive Functions</strong></p>
            <p>It is one that invokes itself until a certain condition is met. It’s a useful tool to use when iterative processes are involved.</p>
            <p>-Callbacks<br>You’ll recall that they’re functions passed to other functions as arguments and then invoked inside the function they are passed to.</p>
            <p>-Event-driven Asynchronous Programming<br>Callbacks can help here to facilitate, instead of waiting for an event to occur, a callback can be created that’s invoked when the event happens. If an event only takes a small amount of time to happen, it will still have to wait until other parts of the program have executed before the callback is invoked.</p>
            <p>-Callback Hell<br>When more and more callbacks are being used, the result is messy and confusing. This is when more than one callback is used in the same function, resulting in a large number of nested blocks that are difficult to comprehend. This term of Callback hell is used to refer to this tangled mess of code.</p>
            <p>-Promises<br>It represents the future result of an asynchronous operation, they don’t do anything that can’t already be achieved using callbacks, they help to simplify the process.</p>
            <p>When a promise is created, it’s like we say to the computer that it must do something and it returns with an operation according its state (Resolved and Rejected).</p>
            <p>Once a promise has been settled, the then() method can be used to deal with the outcome. The catch() method can be used to specify what to do if the operation fails instead.</p>
            <p>-Async Functions<br>These functions are preceded by the async keyword and allow you to write asynchronous code as if it was synchronous.</p>
            <p>-Generalized Functions<br>Callbacks can be used to build more generalized functions. Instead of having lots of specific functions, one function can be written that accepts a callback. </p>
            <p>-Functions that returns functions<br>If we want to work with that, we should be clear that we need to assign it in a variable, for example, a function that search a data from the Database, so if that result doesn’t store in a variable, it’s like going nowhere.</p>
            <p><strong>Closures</strong></p>
            <p>It’s really important to understand the difference between inside and outside variables, the best way to understand is through using a function where you can put a variable that will run only in the scope.</p>
            <p>Also, we can have access from an inside to declared variables in the outer function’s scope. It is important as the variable outside should only exist while the outer() function is running. The closure maintains access to this variable, however, even though the outer() has been invoked.</p>
            <p>-Generators<br>ES6 introduced support for generators. These are special functions used to produce iterators that maintain the state of a value. Calling a generator function doesn’t actually run any of the code in the function; it returns a Generator object that can be used to create an iterator that implements a next() method that returns a value every time the next() method is called. Generator functions employ the special yield keyword that is used to return a value. The difference between the yield and the return keywords is that by using yield, the state of the value returned is remembered the next time yield is called.</p>
            <p><strong>Functional Programming</strong></p>
            <p>Functional programming has gained momentum in recent years. The popularity of purely functional languages, such as Clojure, Scala and Erlang, sparked an interest in functional programming techniques that continues to grow. The ability to pass functions as arguments, return them from other functions, and use anonymous functions and closures, are all fundamental elements of functional programming that JavaScript excels at.</p>
            <p>Functional programming uses pure functions as the building blocks of a program. The functions perform a series of operations without changing the state of any data. Each function forms an abstraction that should perform a single task, while encapsulating the details of its implementation inside the body of the function. This means that a program becomes a sequence of expressions based on the return values of pure functions. The emphasis is placed on using function composition to combine pure functions together to complete more complex tasks.</p>
            <p>Higher-order functions are functions that accept another function as an argument, or return another function as a result, or both. When a higher-order function returns another function, we can use a neat trick to create an anonymous return function and immediately invoke it with a value instead by using double parentheses.</p>
            <p>Currying is a process that involves the partial application of functions. It’s named after the logician Haskell Curry. A function is said to be curried when not all arguments have been supplied to the function, so it returns another function that retains the arguments already provided, and expects the remaining arguments that were omitted when the original function was called. A final result is only returned once all the expected arguments have eventually been provided.</p>
            <p>We could use a curry() function to take any function and allow it to be partially applied, here there’s an example:</p>

             <h2>AJAX</h2>
             <p>Ajax is a technique that allows web pages to communicate asynchronously with a server, and it dynamically updates web pages without reloading. We can send data in background, and part of the page can be updated in response to user events</p>
             <p>A client, such as a web browser, will request a resource (usually a web page) from a server, which processes the request and sends back a response to the client. </p>
             <p>Ajax allows JavaScript to request resources from a server on behalf of the client. The resources requested are usually JSON data.</p>
             <p>Consequently, a server is required when requesting resources using Ajax. Typically, this involves using a server-side language, such as PHP, Ruby, Node.js, or .NET to serve the data response following an Ajax request (usually from a back-end database).</p>
             <p>Ajax was a neat acronym that referred to the different parts of the process being used: Asynchronous JavaScript and XML.</p>
            <p>Asynchronous: When a request for data is sent, the program doesn’t have to stop and wait for the response. It can carry on running, waiting for an event to fire when a response is received.</p>
            <p>JavaScript: Ajax enabled JavaScript to send requests and receive responses from a server, allowing content to be updated in real time.</p>
            <p>XML: When the term Ajax was originally coined, XML documents were often used to return data. JSON also has the advantage of being natively supported in JavaScript, so you can deal with JavaScript objects rather than having to parse XML files using DOM methods.</p>
            <div class="pl25px">
                <p><strong>Redirects:</strong> After a response if it’s right we can be redirected to another URL</p>
                <p><strong>Text Responses:</strong> We receive some answer so we can inner this content in our page.</p>
                <p><strong>File Responses:</strong> This is really cool, it’s used to make secure video players.</p>
                <p><strong>JSON Responses:</strong> It’s really popular because we have different data that we can use it.</p>
            </div>
            <p>Although most of the time you will be dealing with a response object that is returned from a request you make, you can also create your own response objects using a constructor function.</p>
            <p>We can get more fine-grained control over the request being made by providing a Request object as an argument, with this we can have a number of options to be set about the request.</p>
            <p>The Fetch API includes the FormData interface, which makes it much easier to submit information in forms using Ajax.</p>
            <p>The Fetch API is, at the time of writing, what is known as a “living standard”, which means that the specification is being developed in the wild. This means that, despite it being available to use, it’s still subject to change as developers, browser vendors and end-users provide feedback about how it works.</p>
            <p>We can consider using a library to take care of Ajax requests, because it’ll handler of the implantation form me.</p>
