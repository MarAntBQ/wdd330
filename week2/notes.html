           <p>It’s really interesting to know about the Automatic Semicolon Insertion, but in my case, I really love to use Semi Colon. About variables, I used to use the word <strong>“VAR,”</strong> but it’s interesting to know that people use const and let.</p>
           <p>The ways to define variables are interesting because the way they’re declared make a real difference, even avoid using the <strong>jQuery</strong> was is really helpful.</p>
          <p>I didn’t know about <strong>Template Literals</strong>, it’s like using another programming language for example PHP when I want to declare a variable inside a string with <strong>${ varname }.</strong></p>
          <p>When I read about Bitwise, there was a thought about: “The first programmers had a hard job” because doing everything with 0 or 1 it’s really complicated. The <strong>.isNaN()</strong> method is really help if something isn’t a number. Prompt is entering a value from the screen, I really love to enter by an input, and call it with a function inside a button.</p>
          <p>The Array shift delete the first element, pop will be the last one. I learned new ways to include elements to an array, for example using concat or join, I was impressed about Ternary Operator, this is the first time I see it as a new way of If, but I don’t really like it, I love the if one, maybe I’ll try to use it.</p>
          <p><strong title="Don't Repeat yourself">DRY</strong> is really important in our code, because if we repeat the same functions my code can be really confused, and takes more time. I’m impressed it’s about the Hoisting Functions, that they can be call before they’re expressed.</p>
          <p><em>After reading there’s a question that came to my mind: Why Am I learning about JS again? it’s because I need to master this language, because it’s one of the most used in the world, and it helps me to go beyond with Node.JS</em></p>
